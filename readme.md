# Interview Code Samples

## Overview
This repository contains two independent projects that demonstrate my work with ML,DL, and federated learning  

The projects cover:
- Federated intrusion detection in UAV networks (cybersecurity focus)  
- Car price prediction using neural networks and federated learning(regression and distributed ML)  

Each project is organized into its own folder with code, datasets (or samples), and a README containing details and instructions for running the code.

## Projects

Project 1: Federated Learning for Multi-Layer Attack Detection in UAVs(project1/)
- Simulates UAV clients participating in a federated learning system.
- Detects and classifies multiple types of cyberattacks.
- Uses deep learning models trained in a privacy-preserving way.

Project 2: Federated Car Price Prediction(project2/)
- Preprocesses a car price dataset (scaling + categorical encoding).
- Trains a PyTorch neural network to predict car prices.
- Implements a federated learning simulation using Flower.
